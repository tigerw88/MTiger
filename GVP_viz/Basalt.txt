Ofu-Olosega	14804	244010	Shield	Caldera	Pyroclastic cone	NAN	NAN	NAN	Subduction zone / Oceanic crust (< 15 km)	Basalt / Picro-Basalt	United States	Confirmed Eruption	1866	9	12	1866	11	15	0	2	NAN	-14.175	-169.618	639	The two triangle-shaped islands of Ofu and Olosega in eastern Samoa, with a combined length of 6 km, are separated by a narrow strait.  The islands are formed by two eroded, coalescing basaltic shield volcanoes whose slopes dip to the east and west.  Steep cliffs up to 600-m high truncate the northern and southern sides of the islands.  The narrow, steep-sided ridge forming the eastern tip of Ofu Island consists of a dike complex.  The shield volcano on Ofu is cut on the north by the A'ofa caldera; bathymetry suggests that a caldera may also exist on the Sili shield volcano of Olosega.  The Nu'utele tuff cone, forming a small crescent-shaped island immediately off the west end of Ofu Island, is Holocene in age.  A submarine eruption took place in 1866 at the opposite end of the two islands, 3 km SE of Olosega, along the ridge connecting Olosega with Ta'u Island.

Four large radial valleys extend from the unvegetated summit of the conical 1807-m-high basaltic-andesitic stratovolcano to its lower flanks. These "avalanche valleys" channel lava flows and pyroclastic avalanches that have sometimes reached the coast. Five small satellitic centers are located near the island's shoreline on the northern, southern, and western sides. Two summit craters are present; both are active, although most historical eruptions have originated from the southern crater, concentrating eruptive products during much of the past century into the SE valley. Frequent historical eruptions, typically of mild-to-moderate scale, have been recorded since 1616. Occasional larger eruptions have produced pyroclastic flows and lava flows that reached flat-lying coastal areas and entered the sea, sometimes impacting populated areas.

Four large radial valleys extend from the unvegetated summit of the conical 1807-m-high basaltic-andesitic stratovolcano to its lower flanks. These "avalanche valleys" channel lava flows and pyroclastic avalanches that have sometimes reached the coast. Five small satellitic centers are located near the island's shoreline on the northern, southern, and western sides. Two summit craters are present; both are active, although most historical eruptions have originated from the southern crater, concentrating eruptive products during much of the past century into the SE valley.

Several historical explosive eruptions had been recorded prior to 1888, when large-scale slope failure destroyed the summit of the conical basaltic-andesitic volcano, leaving the arcuate 140-m-high island remnant with a steep west-facing scarp that descends below sea level.  Devastating tsunamis were produced by the collapse and swept the coast of Papua New Guinea and offshore islands.  Two minor post-collapse explosive eruptions, during 1972 and 1974, occurred offshore within the largely submarine 3.5 x 4.5 km breached depression formed by the collapse.

Ulawun volcano, also known as the Father, rises above the north coast of the island of New Britain across a low saddle NE of Bamus volcano, the South Son.  The upper 1000 m of the 2334-m-high Ulawun volcano is unvegetated.  A  prominent E-W-trending escarpment on the south may be the result of large-scale slumping.  Satellitic cones occupy the NW and eastern flanks.  A steep-walled valley cuts the NW side of Ulawun volcano, and a flank lava-flow complex lies to the south of this valley.  Historical eruptions date back to the beginning of the 18th century.

Mounts Rantop, Nagat, and Oulenou are small basaltic-to-andesitic stratovolcanoes with well-preserved morphologies.  Mount Rantop is the largest, rising to 837 m, and 421-m-high Mount Oulenou is the most youthful looking, with an unbreached crater.  A low plateau to the NW is underlain by ash deposits distributed by southeasterly trade winds.  The volcanoes initially formed an offshore island that was joined to the mainland by uplift after volcanism ceased.  A submarine vent offshore between the tip of the peninsula and Goat Island, 5 km to the NE, erupted in 1881, the only historical activity of the Erromango volcanoes.

Lake-filled maars, including Ranu Pakis, Ranu Klakah, and Ranu Bedali, are located on the eastern and western flanks; dry maars are predominately located on the northern flanks.  None of the Lamongan maars has erupted during historical time, although several of the youthful maars cut drainage channels from Gunung Tarub.  Lamongan was very active from the time of its first historical eruption in 1799 through the end of the 19th century, producing frequent explosive eruptions and lava flows from vents on the western side of the volcano ranging from the summit to about 450 m elevation.

Jolo lies in the Sulu archipelago, about 150 km SW of the tip of the Zamboanga Peninsula on SW Mindanao Island.  The isolated location of Jolo and political unrest have inhibited geological studies of the volcanic island.  Youthful-looking Tumatangus volcano forms the 811 m high point of the island.  Bud Dajo (or Buddajo) is a young basaltic cinder cone that reaches 620 m elevation; nearby cones are Matanding, Guimba, and Sungal.  Hot springs have been reported at craters on Cagayan Sulu, and solfataras at Siit Lake.  A tsunami accompanied a possible submarine eruption in 1897.  A reported eruption in 1641 actually reflected ashfall from the eruption of Parker volcano on Mindanao.

Construction of several stratovolcanoes continued throughout much of the Pleistocene and overlapped with growth of smaller monogenetic volcanoes beginning about 300,000 years ago. About 70 subaerial monogenetic volcanoes formed during the last 140,000 years, and chemically similar submarine cones are located offshore. These volcanoes are located on a basement of late-Tertiary volcanic rocks and related sediments and on the flanks of three Quaternary stratovolcanoes: Amagi, Tenshi, and Usami. Some eruptive vents are controlled by NW-SE- or NE-SW-trending fissure systems. Thirteen eruptive episodes have been documented during the past 32,000 years. Kawagodaira maar produced pyroclastic flows during the largest Holocene eruption about 3000 years ago. The latest eruption occurred in 1989, when a small submarine crater was formed NE of Ito City.

Growth of the Younger Fuji volcano began with a period of voluminous lava flows from 11,000 to 8000 years before present (BP), accounting for four-fifths of the volume of the Younger Fuji volcano. Minor explosive eruptions dominated activity from 8000 to 4500 BP, with another period of major lava flows occurring from 4500 to 3000 BP. Subsequently, intermittent major explosive eruptions occurred, with subordinate lava flows and small pyroclastic flows. Summit eruptions dominated from 3000 to 2000 BP, after which flank vents were active. The extensive basaltic lava flows from the summit and some of the more than 100 flank cones and vents blocked drainages against the Tertiary Misaka Mountains on the north side of the volcano, forming the Fuji Five Lakes, popular resort destinations. The last confirmed eruption of this dominantly basaltic volcano in 1707 was Fuji's largest during historical time. It deposited ash on Edo (Tokyo) and formed a large new crater on the east flank.

After the growth of Nishi-Iwate volcano beginning about 700,000 years ago, activity migrated eastward to form Higashi-Iwate volcano. Iwate has collapsed seven times during the past 230,000 years, most recently between 739 and 1615 AD. The dominantly basaltic summit cone of Higashi-Iwate volcano, Yakushidake, is truncated by a 500-m-wide crater. It rises well above and buries the eastern rim of the caldera, which is breached by a narrow gorge on the NW.

Growth of the volcano began with construction of the Kurosaki stratovolcano in the NW part of the island, after which the main stratovolcano began growing in the SE. Both summit and flank vents produced pyroclastic surges and lava flows. Late in the construction of the main cone a 1-1.5 km crater was formed on the SE flank. About 3000 years ago pyroclastic surges swept over the entire island. During about the next 600 years, lava flows and scoria deposits filled the SE crater, which also collapsed repeatedly. The current Ikenosawa crater was considered by Takada et al. (1992) to have formed by ring collapse at the time of a debris avalanche, after which the volcano was quiescent until the eruptions of historical time.

The Kuttara group was constructed during five major eruptive stages, the first of which occurred more than 60,000 years ago. A major dacitic pumice eruption at the end of the 4th stage about 40,000 years ago resulted in the formation of the 3-km-diameter Kuttara caldera. The caldera cut a basaltic-to-andesitic stratovolcano complex, which late in its activity produced two major andesitic lava flows on its north side at Kita-yama. Explosions, probably in early Holocene time, formed two large craters on the west flank of the caldera, and a dacitic lava dome was emplaced about 10,000 years ago. Late-stage phreatic explosion products from Jigoku-dani, a 300-400 m wide crater south of the lava dome, overlie the 1663 tephra from Usu volcano. Jigoku-dani and Noboribetsu Spa are the sites of intense thermal activity, including fumaroles, hot springs, and geysers.

Lava flows from 1781-m-high Chikurachki reached the sea and form capes on the NW coast; several young lava flows also emerge from beneath the scoria blanket on the eastern flank. The Tatarinov group of six volcanic centers is located immediately to the south of Chikurachki, and the Lomonosov cinder cone group, the source of an early Holocene lava flow that reached the saddle between it and Fuss Peak to the west, lies at the southern end of the N-S-trending Chikurachki-Tatarinov complex. In contrast to the frequently active Chikurachki, the Tatarinov volcanoes are extensively modified by erosion and have a more complex structure. Tephrochronology gives evidence of only one eruption in historical time from Tatarinov, although its southern cone contains a sulfur-encrusted crater with fumaroles that were active along the margin of a crater lake until 1959.

Central Koshelev stratovolcano, the highest peak of the volcanic massif, is Holocene in age; N- and SE-flank craters have also been active during the Holocene. Gorely, a Holocene cinder cone related to regional basaltic monogenetic volcanicm, is located about 12 km NW. The largest Holocene eruption at Koshelev took place from the eastern cone about 6500 years ago. An explosive eruption was reported at the end of the 17th century. Major thermal fields are located in the summit crater of Valentin volcano and on the western flanks of west Koshelev volcano.

A late-Holocene explosive eruption formed a 1.6-km-wide summit crater that was subsequently largely filled by four lava domes, the latest of which forms the present 1926-m-high summit.  Several of the lava domes were emplaced along the buried SE rim of the summit crater. More than ten cinder cones and lava domes were constructed on the flanks, particularly on the NW side. Only a few eruptions are known in historical time. The largest, in 1923, produced explosive activity and a lava flow down the SE flank that also partly flowed into the summit crater.

The 2439-m-high volcano was constructed during the late-Pleistocene to Holocene at the northern end of the 12 x 14 km, 40,000-year-old Opala caldera. The volcano has produced andesitic-dacitic lavas and tephras through most of the Holocene. The latest major explosive eruption formed the prominent Barany Amphitheater on the SE flank about 1500 years ago, producing a voluminous 9-10 cu km regional tephra marker layer of rhyolitic composition. The 2 x 2.5 km crater is filled by a lava dome 1 km wide. Mild explosive eruptions have been reported from summit and flank vents in historical time, although no associated tephra deposits have been found. Recent tephrochronological work has revealed evidence, however, for a large explosive eruption from the summit crater about 300 years ago.

Growth of the modern volcano began during the middle Holocene about 4800 years ago with construction of the Zapadny cone. After a long quiescence, the younger Savich cone was born about 1400 years ago, following a strong explosive eruption that destroyed part of the Zapadny and Pik cones. Numerous young lava flows mantle the flanks of Savich cone, which has grown to slightly exceed Zapadny as the high point of Kikhpinych volcano. Savich was last active about 400 years ago, when the Krab lava dome was formed on its eastern flank. Numerous thermal fields are found throughout the complex, including two geysers (now the site of vigorous fumaroles) that were active in the summit crater of Stary Kikhpinych prior to burial by a rockfall avalanche that occurred sometime between September 1981 and July 1982.

Young lava flows from summit and flank vents descend into the caldera and down its outer flanks. The summit cones are situated along a NE-SW-trending fissure that has also produced zones of Holocene cinder cones extending 15-20 km beyond the caldera. Tephra deposits from the caldera-forming eruption directly overlie a 39,000 before present (BP) tephra once thought to be related to that eruption but now thought to be associated with the formation of Uzon caldera (Florenskii 1988). Both the Southern and Northern cones are topped by 800-m-wide craters; the younger Northern Cone was constructed within a 2-km-wide caldera. Construction of the Southern Cone began about 11,000 years BP and lasted for about 4500 years. The Northern Cone was constructed during a cycle of similar length that began about 6500 years ago.

The andesitic Pleistocene-to-Holocene stratovolcano, also known as Icha volcano, contains a 3 x 5 km-wide glacier-covered summit caldera filled by a large post-caldera edifice. Two glacier-capped lava domes form the highest peaks of 3596-m-high Ichinsky. A dozen late-Pleistocene to Holocene dacitic and rhyodacitic lava domes circle the peak below the caldera rim, at elevations of 1800-3000 m. Fresh-looking basaltic-to-dacitic lava flows, some with prominent flow ridges, were erupted from flank vents and traveled up to 10-15 km. The largest Holocene eruption took place about 6500 years ago, producing block-and-ash flows that traveled up to 15 km. Fumarolic activity occurs within the caldera and on the lower northern flank. In 1956 steam jets rose 250 m above the caldera fumarole field.

Both 2598-m-high Alney on the north and 2526-m-high Chashakondzha on the south are capped with andesitic lava domes.  Three rhyodacitic-to-rhyolitic lava domes and associated lava flows were emplaced along ring faults enclosing a 15 x 20 km area.  Two cinder cones on the east flanks of Alney and Chashakondzha volcanoes erupted about 2600 years ago and produced lava flows, one of which traveled as far as 9 km down the eastern flanks of the complex.  Alney is one of the few large stratovolcanoes in the Sredinny Range known to have been active throughout the Holocene, with more than 30 documented pyroclastic deposits.  The last intense eruption took place about 350 years ago.

It formed as a result of collapse of a low-angle, dominantly basaltic volcano following the eruption of a large volume of dacitic pumice.  The high point of the island is 1221-m-high Anvil Peak, a double-peaked late-Pleistocene cone that forms much of the island's northern part.  The three-peaked 774-m-high Mount Cerberus volcano was constructed during the Holocene within the caldera.  Each of the peaks contains a summit crater; lava flows on the northern flank of Cerberus appear younger than those on the southern side.

A major explosive eruption in 2008 produced pyroclastic flows and surges that swept into the sea, extending the island's shoreline.

A major dacitic explosive eruption accompanied formation of the caldera about 500,000 to 300,000 years ago. The most prominent of the post-caldera stratovolcanoes are Kliuchef and Sarichef, both of which may have been active in historical time. Sarichef has a symmetrical profile, but the less eroded Kliuchef is the source of most if not all historical eruptions. Kliuchef may have been active on occasion simultaneously with Korovin volcano to the north. Hot springs and fumaroles are located on the flanks of Mount Kliuchef and in a glacial valley SW of Kliuchef.

The basaltic maars were erupted through glacial deposits in the Bering Sea lowlands 1.5 km south of Becharof Lake and 12 km west of Peulik volcano; their location is related to the regional Bruin Bay fault.   The elliptical West Maar, which was the first to form, is 105 x 170 m wide and 35 m deep.  The other maar, 600 m to the east, is 300 m wide and 70 m deep.  Both maars are now filled by crater lakes; the eastern lake encircles a 49-m-high lava dome that was emplaced at the end of the eruption.  Base surges were directed primarily to the NW.  Juvenile material from the Ukinrek eruptions was of mantle-derived olivine basaltic composition.  The dacitic Gas Rocks lava domes, of Quaternary age, are located on the shores of Becharof Lake, 3 km north of Ukinrek maars and were the site of a phreatic eruption about 2300 years ago.

Construction of Meseta dates back to about 230,000 years and continued until the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. Collapse of Meseta may have produced the massive Escuintla debris-avalanche deposit, which extends about 50 km onto the Pacific coastal plain. Growth of the modern Fuego volcano followed, continuing the southward migration of volcanism that began at Acatenango. In contrast to the mostly andesitic Acatenango, eruptions at Fuego have become more mafic with time, and most historical activity has produced basaltic rocks. Frequent vigorous historical eruptions have been recorded since the onset of the Spanish era in 1524, and have produced major ashfalls, along with occasional pyroclastic flows and lava flows.

Growth of the modern Fuego volcano followed, continuing the southward migration of volcanism that began at Acatenango. In contrast to the mostly andesitic Acatenango, eruptions at Fuego have become more mafic with time, and most historical activity has produced basaltic rocks. Frequent vigorous historical eruptions have been recorded since the onset of the Spanish era in 1524, and have produced major ashfalls, along with occasional pyroclastic flows and lava flows.

Construction of Meseta dates back to about 230,000 years and continued until the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. Collapse of Meseta may have produced the massive Escuintla debris-avalanche deposit, which extends about 50 km onto the Pacific coastal plain. Growth of the modern Fuego volcano followed, continuing the southward migration of volcanism that began at Acatenango. In contrast to the mostly andesitic Acatenango, eruptions at Fuego have become more mafic with time, and most historical activity has produced basaltic rocks. Frequent vigorous historical eruptions have been recorded since the onset of the Spanish era in 1524, and have produced major ashfalls, along with occasional pyroclastic flows and lava flows.

Frequent vigorous historical eruptions have been recorded since the onset of the Spanish era in 1524, and have produced major ashfalls, along with occasional pyroclastic flows and lava flows.

This complex basaltic volcano was constructed just outside the southern topographic rim of the 14 x 16 km Pleistocene Amatitlán caldera. A cluster of dacitic lava domes occupies the southern caldera floor. The post-caldera Pacaya massif includes the ancestral Pacaya Viejo and Cerro Grande stratovolcanoes and the currently active Mackenney stratovolcano. Collapse of Pacaya Viejo between 600 and 1500 years ago produced a debris-avalanche deposit that extends 25 km onto the Pacific coastal plain and left an arcuate somma rim inside which the modern Pacaya volcano (Mackenney cone) grew. A subsidiary crater, Cerro Chino, was constructed on the NW somma rim and was last active in the 19th century. During the past several decades, activity has consisted of frequent strombolian eruptions with intermittent lava flow extrusion that has partially filled in the caldera moat and armored the flanks of Mackenney cone, punctuated by occasional larger explosive eruptions that partially destroy the summit of the growing young stratovolcano.

Collapse of Pacaya Viejo between 600 and 1500 years ago produced a debris-avalanche deposit that extends 25 km onto the Pacific coastal plain and left an arcuate somma rim inside which the modern Pacaya volcano (Mackenney cone) grew. A subsidiary crater, Cerro Chino, was constructed on the NW somma rim and was last active in the 19th century. During the past several decades, activity has consisted of frequent strombolian eruptions with intermittent lava flow extrusion that has partially filled in the caldera moat and armored the flanks of Mackenney cone, punctuated by occasional larger explosive eruptions that partially destroy the summit of the growing young stratovolcano.

It lies within the massive Pleistocene Las Sierras pyroclastic shield volcano and is a broad, 6 x 11 km basaltic caldera with steep-sided walls up to 300 m high. The caldera is filled on its NW end by more than a dozen vents that erupted along a circular, 4-km-diameter fracture system. The twin volcanoes of Nindirí and Masaya, the source of historical eruptions, were constructed at the southern end of the fracture system and contain multiple summit craters, including the currently active Santiago crater. A major basaltic plinian tephra erupted from Masaya about 6500 years ago. Historical lava flows cover much of the caldera floor and have confined a lake to the far eastern end of the caldera. A lava flow from the 1670 eruption overtopped the north caldera rim. Masaya has been frequently active since the time of the Spanish Conquistadors, when an active lava lake prompted attempts to extract the volcano's molten "gold." Periods of long-term vigorous gas emission at roughly quarter-century intervals cause health hazards and crop damage.

It lies within the massive Pleistocene Las Sierras pyroclastic shield volcano and is a broad, 6 x 11 km basaltic caldera with steep-sided walls up to 300 m high. The caldera is filled on its NW end by more than a dozen vents that erupted along a circular, 4-km-diameter fracture system. The twin volcanoes of Nindirí and Masaya, the source of historical eruptions, were constructed at the southern end of the fracture system and contain multiple summit craters, including the currently active Santiago crater. A major basaltic plinian tephra erupted from Masaya about 6500 years ago. Historical lava flows cover much of the caldera floor and have confined a lake to the far eastern end of the caldera.

The Huanquihué volcano group consists of a NNE-SSW-trending chain of stratovolcanoes of Pleistocene age, some of which lie along the border. A Holocene compound cinder cone with three nested craters up to 400 m in diameter that occupied a valley NE of Cerro Huanquihué and a tuff cone constructed within glacial Lake Epulafquen lies at the northern end of the chain. Growth of this Holocene tuff cone, La Angostura ("The Narrowing"), created a peninsula that formed a narrow channel connecting Lake Epulafquen and Lake Huechulafquen. A very recent lava flow from the base of the Achín-Niellu cinder cone (also known as Cerro Escorial) traveled north into glacial Lago Epulafquen, forming a prominent lava delta.  The Escorial lava flow is an extremely youthful flow that diverted local drainages and formed new  lakes.  A radiocarbon date of about 200 years before present was obtained from this flow, and local residents recount oral histories of the eruption, which was observed by their grandparents.

Flank scoria cones and fissure vents, primarily on the west and SW sides, have produced lava flows that reached Lago Llanquihué.  Frequent explosive eruptions including pyroclastic flows and surges have occurred during the past 14,000 years. Historical eruptions have originated from both summit and flank vents, producing basaltic and andesitic lava flows that have entered both Llanquihué and Todos los Santos lakes.

Cerro Hudson is the southernmost volcano in the Chilean Andes related to subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate.  The massive, 1905-m-high Cerro Hudson covers an area of 300 sq km.  The compound caldera is drained through a breach on its NW rim, which has been the source of mudflows down the Río de Los Huemeles.  Two cinder cones occur north of the volcano and others occupy the SW and SE flanks.  Hudson has been the source of several major Holocene explosive eruptions.  An eruption about 6700 years ago was one of the largest known in the southern Andes during the Holocene; another eruption about 3600 years ago also produced more than 10 cu km of tephra.  An eruption in 1991 was Chile's second largest of the 20th century and formed a new 800-m-wide crater in the SW part of the caldera.

A cluster of parasitic cones on the SE flank, the Ashen Hills, appear to have been modified since 1820 (LeMasurier and Thomson 1990). Vapor emission is frequently reported from the summit crater. Recent AVHRR and MODIS satellite imagery has revealed evidence for lava lake activity in the summit crater.

Lava flows along the cliff dip to the west, suggesting that the original summit vent was beyond the eastern shoreline. The northern end of the irregularly shaped, 6-km-long island consists of an andesitic-to-dacitic complex of scoria cones with radiating lava flows. These initially formed a separate island but now consist of a low attached platform that is estimated to be no more than a few hundred years old (LeMasurier and Thomson, 1990). Dark brown clouds mixed with white steam were reported in 1823 and 1911, but it has not been demonstrated which, if any, of the young north flank lava flows formed since the island was discovered in 1775. Geysers and hot pools have been observed on several occasions during the 20th century.  Vindication Island, of possible Holocene age, is located 4.5 km west of Candlemas Island.

Mount Curry, the island's summit, lies west of the center of the island, which is more eroded on that side. Two fissures extend NE from the summit towards the east-flank craters, and a lava platform is located along the eastern coast.  Zavodovski is the most frequently visited of the South Sandwich Islands. It was erupting when first seen in 1819 by the explorer Bellingshausen, and the volcano has been reported to be smoking during subsequent visits.
