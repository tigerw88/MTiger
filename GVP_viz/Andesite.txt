Taranaki [Egmont]	14453	241030	Stratovolcano	Lava dome	NAN	NAN	NAN	NAN	Subduction zone / Continental crust (> 25 km)	Andesite / Basaltic Andesite	New Zealand	Confirmed Eruption	1500	0	0	NAN	NAN	NAN	NAN	NAN	NAN	-39.300	174.070	2518	The nearly symmetrical, steep-sided cone of Taranaki (also known as Egmont), is New Zealand's largest andesitic stratovolcano. Taranaki is surrounded by a ring plain of debris-avalanche and lahar deposits that and extend to the coast. The isolated volcanic center is located on the west coast of central North Island at the southern end of a volcanic arc extending NW along the Northland Peninsula. Taranaki is the youngest and SE-most of a group of three volcanoes beginning with the Pleistocene Kaitoke Range. Fanthams Peak breaks the symmetry of Taranaki on its south flank, and four lava domes are located on the lower north and south flanks. Multiple episodes of edifice collapse have occurred in the past 50,000 years. Explosive activity, sometimes accompanied by pyroclastic flows and lava dome growth, has occurred frequently throughout the Holocene. Taranaki's latest eruption took place in 1854 CE.

The 321-m-high island consists of two overlapping andesitic-to-dacitic stratovolcanoes; the summit crater appears to be breached to the SE because the shoreline corresponds to the level of several notches in the SE crater wall.  Volckner Rocks, four sea stacks that are remnants of a lava dome, lie 5 km NNE of White Island.  Intermittent moderate phreatomagmatic and strombolian eruptions have occurred at White Island throughout the short historical period beginning in 1826, but its activity also forms a prominent part of Maori legends.  Formation of many new vents during the 19th and 20th centuries has produced rapid changes in crater floor topography.  Collapse of the crater wall in 1914 produced a debris avalanche that buried buildings and workers at a sulfur-mining project.

The 110 cu km dominantly andesitic volcanic massif is elongated in a NNE-SSW direction and surrounded by another 100 cu km ring plain of volcaniclastic debris, including the Murimoto debris-avalanche deposit on the NW flank. A series of subplinian eruptions took place between about 22,600 and 10,000 years ago, but pyroclastic flows have been infrequent. A single historically active vent, Crater Lake, is located in the broad summit region, but at least five other vents on the summit and flank have been active during the Holocene. Frequent mild-to-moderate explosive eruptions have occurred in historical time from the Crater Lake vent, and tephra characteristics suggest that the crater lake may have formed as early as 3000 years ago. Lahars produced by phreatic eruptions from the summit crater lake are a hazard to a ski area on the upper flanks and to lower river valleys.

The high point of the Nabukelevu complex is 805 m Mt. Washington, an andesitic lava dome.  Flat-lying dacitic lava flows are found at Cape Washington along the west coast and at Talaulia Bay on the NE coast.  NNE-trending faults cut the complex in several locations and define its eastern boundary.  The dome complex is cut by several collapse scarps that were the source of debris avalanches that have incorporated human artifacts and remains.  Debris avalanches have entered the sea on the both the northern and southern sides of the volcano.  Onshore and offshore deposits as well as native legends indicate that several eruptions have occurred at Nabukelevu during the Holocene.  Block-and-ash flows related to dome growth have occurred within the past few hundred years.

The 5.5-km-wide outer caldera was formed during one or more eruptions, the last of which occurred 9000 years ago. The eccentric 3.2-km-wide inner caldera was formed sometime between 1500 and 800 years ago.

A major submarine debris-avalanche deposit NE of the volcano may represent edifice collapse prior to caldera formation. The latest episode of caldera formation occurred as recently as about 1150 years ago, and was followed by at least five subplinian or vulcanian eruptions. A 12-km-wide, freshwater lake whose surface is only about 50 m above sea level occupies the caldera. Two vertical fault-bounded blocks form topographic highs at the western and eastern sides of the caldera. A N-S-trending line of post-caldera cones, explosion craters, and part of an arcuate inner caldera rim form a large peninsula that nearly bisects the horseshoe-shaped caldera lake. The peninsula includes the 350-m-high andesitic Mount Makalia stratovolcano, the largest of the post-caldera cones, which last erupted during the late-19th century. Thermal areas occur at several locations along the central peninsula.

Prior to its renowned devastating eruption in 1951, the forested peak had not been recognized as a volcano.  Mount Lamington rises to 1680 m above the coastal plain north of the Owen Stanley Range.  A summit complex of lava domes and crater remnants rises above a low-angle base of volcaniclastic deposits that are dissected by radial valleys.  A prominent broad "avalanche valley" extends northward from the breached crater.  Ash layers from two early Holocene eruptions at Lamington have been identified.  After a long quiescent period, the volcano sprang suddenly to life in 1951, producing a powerful explosive eruption during which devastating pyroclastic flows and surges swept all sides of the volcano, killing nearly 3000 persons.  The eruption concluded with growth of a 560-m-high lava dome in the summit crater.

Mount Victory is densely mantled by rainforest, which is somewhat stunted near the summit.  On the NE it abutts the deeply dissected Pleistocene Mount Trafalgar volcano.  The summit crater of Mount Victory is breached to the SE and is of possible landslide origin.  Several near-summit lava domes are present, the SE-most of which marks the 1925-m-high summit of the volcano.  Four small satellite cones are located on the SW side, and two others occur on the NE flank.  The only confirmed historical activity of Mount Victory was a long-term late-19th to early 20th-century eruption that provided a beacon for passing ships.  Pyroclastic flows that destroyed several villages and caused fatalities reached the coast.

Two major explosive eruptions, one about 900 years ago and the other about 370 years ago, produced dacitic pyroclastic-fall deposits that cover most of the northern half of Bougainville Island.  The younger eruption may have been responsible for formation of the nearly vertical, steep-walled summit caldera.  Pyroclastic-flow and -surge deposits from Billy Mitchell extend 25 km to the eastern coast of Bougainville Island.

The only Potassium-Argon date (2.3 +/- 1 million years ago from Mount Patukio) suggests a Pliocene-to-Pleistocene age for the island (Solomon Islands Geological Survey, 1982). The southern half of the island is thermally active. It contains fault-related fumarolic areas and hot springs near saltwater Lake Ove along the western coast and along the eastern coast near Mount Patukio, which has a steep-walled summit crater. Grover (1955) noted native accounts of the explosive enlargement of the Ngusunu explosion crater along the SW coast of the island one to two generations prior to 1955, probably after a visit by Guppy in 1882. Press reports mentioned an eruption in the early 1900s that forced the evacuation of villages beside Lake Ove, immediately adjacent to Ngusunu crater.

Lava domes of historical age are located on the crater floor and its NE rim, and older domes occur on the flanks of the volcano.  Pyroclastic flows and mudflows traveled down valleys from the summit crater to form debris fans along the coast.   Thermal areas located in the summit crater, the south to SE flanks, and offshore include areas of steaming ground, fumaroles, small geysers, and hot springs.

These have left the upper flanks of the volcano and the steep apron of lava flows and volcaniclastic debris within the breach unvegetated.

This style of activity may have continued for the past 800 years.  Yasur, located at the SE tip of Tanna Island, is a mostly unvegetated 361-m-high pyroclastic cone with a nearly circular, 400-m-wide summit crater.  Yasur is largely contained within the small Yenkahe caldera and is the youngest of a group of Holocene volcanic centers constructed over the down-dropped NE flank of the Pleistocene Tukosmeru volcano.  The Yenkahe horst is located within the Siwi ring fracture, a 4-km-wide, horseshoe-shaped caldera associated with eruption of the andesitic Siwi pyroclastic sequence.  Active tectonism along the Yenkahe horst accompanying eruptions of Yasur has raised Port Resolution harbor more than 20 m during the past century.

A smaller 8 x 6 km caldera lies within Lam Teuba caldera.  The summit contains a forested, 400-m-wide crater.  The active van Heutsz crater, located at 650 m on the NNE flank of Suelawah Agam, is one of several areas containing active fumarole fields.  Sapper (1927) and the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (CAVW) reported an explosive eruption in the early 16th century, and the CAVW also listed an eruption from the van Heutsz crater in 1839.  Rock et al. (1982) found no evidence for historical eruptions.  However the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia noted that although no historical eruptions have occurred from the main cone, the reported NNE-flank explosive activity may have been hydrothermal and not have involved new magmatic activity.

Post-caldera cones are located near the south rim, including Sibayak, Pintau, and Pratektekan. Sibayak and Pintau are twin volcanoes within a small compound caldera open to the north. The 900-m-wide Sibayak crater is partially filled on the north by Pintau. A lava flow traveled through a gap in the western crater wall from the summit lava dome of Sibayak; the active geothermal field SE of the summit has abundant solfataras and fumaroles. Area residents record legends of eruptions. Neumann van Padang (1983) cited a report by Hoekstra of ash clouds that were emitted from the volcano in 1881. The town of Berastagi is situated within the larger Singkut caldera immediately SE of the younger cones.

Remnants of this ancestral volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes, and left only a remnant of Rakata volcano. This eruption, the 2nd largest in Indonesia during historical time, caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of devastating tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java.  Pyroclastic surges traveled 40 km across the Sunda Strait and reached the Sumatra coast. After a quiescence of less than a half century, the post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former cones of Danan and Perbuwatan.

Collapse of the ancestral Krakatau edifice, perhaps in 416 CE, formed a 7-km-wide caldera. Remnants of this ancestral volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes, and left only a remnant of Rakata volcano. This eruption, the 2nd largest in Indonesia during historical time, caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of devastating tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java.

Collapse of the ancestral Krakatau edifice, perhaps in 416 CE, formed a 7-km-wide caldera. Remnants of this ancestral volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes, and left only a remnant of Rakata volcano. This eruption, the 2nd largest in Indonesia during historical time, caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of devastating tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java.  Pyroclastic surges traveled 40 km across the Sunda Strait and reached the Sumatra coast. After a quiescence of less than a half century, the post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former cones of Danan and Perbuwatan. Anak Krakatau has been the site of frequent eruptions since 1927.

The 1699-m-high summit ridge of Gunung Perbakti is elongated in a NW-SE direction, and Gunung Endut volcano rises to 1474 m above a saddle SW of Perbakti.  Gunung Gagak lies to the NW; it is capped by pumice and obsidian, and obsidian lava flows extend to the north and NE.  Quaternary rhyolitic lava domes form a NNE-trending chain at the eastern side of the complex.  Two 2-km-wide depressions on the northern and southern sides of Perbakti form the headwaters of the Kaluwung Herang and Pamatutan rivers, respectively.   The volcanic complex is marked by vigorous geothermal activity.  Fumaroles, mud pots and hot springs are located on the south and SE flanks of Perbakti and at the Kiaraberes area, which includes the commercial geothermal field of Awibengkok.  Mild phreatic eruptions took place during the Holocene into historical time from flank fumarolic fields.

The broad 1.1-km-wide, flat-floored Alun-Alun crater truncates the summit of Papandayan, and Gunung Puntang to the north gives the volcano a twin-peaked appearance.  Several episodes of collapse have given the volcano an irregular profile and produced debris avalanches that have impacted lowland areas beyond the volcano.

Prominent flank cones are located on the north and SE sides of Sumbing, which is somewhat more dissected than Sundoro volcano. An 800-m-wide horseshoe-shaped summit crater breached to the NE is partially filled by a lava dome that fed a lava flow down to 2400 m altitude. Emplacement of the dome followed the eruption of extensive pyroclastic flows down the NE flank. The only report of historical activity, in about 1730 CE, may have produced the small phreatic craters found at the summit.

Parasitic crater lakes and pyroclastic cones are found at the eastern side of the rift.  The younger Lawu volcano contains eroded crater rims; its latest activity, including construction of a lava dome, occurred at the south end.  A fumarolic area is located on the south flank at 2550 m.  The only reported historical eruption from Lawu took place in 1885, when rumblings and light ashfall were reported.  A major eruption reported from Lawu in 1752 was from neighboring Kelut volcano.

A cluster of summit lava domes cut by numerous craters has given the summit a very irregular profile. Satellitic cones and lava domes are also located low on the eastern, western, and SSW flanks. Eruptive activity has in general migrated in a clockwise direction around the summit vent complex. More than 30 eruptions have been recorded from Gunung Kelut since 1000 CE. The ejection of water from the crater lake during the typically short but violent eruptions has created pyroclastic flows and lahars that have caused widespread fatalities and destruction. After more than 5000 people were killed during an eruption in 1919, an ambitious engineering project sought to drain the crater lake. This initial effort lowered the lake by more than 50 m, but the 1951 eruption deepened the crater by 70 m, leaving 50 million cubic meters of water after repair of the damaged drainage tunnels. After more than 200 deaths in the 1966 eruption, a new deeper tunnel was constructed, and the lake's volume before the 1990 eruption was only about 1 million cubic meters.

The ejection of water from the crater lake during the typically short but violent eruptions has created pyroclastic flows and lahars that have caused widespread fatalities and destruction. After more than 5000 people were killed during an eruption in 1919, an ambitious engineering project sought to drain the crater lake. This initial effort lowered the lake by more than 50 m, but the 1951 eruption deepened the crater by 70 m, leaving 50 million cubic meters of water after repair of the damaged drainage tunnels. After more than 200 deaths in the 1966 eruption, a new deeper tunnel was constructed, and the lake's volume before the 1990 eruption was only about 1 million cubic meters.

A cluster of summit lava domes cut by numerous craters has given the summit a very irregular profile. Satellitic cones and lava domes are also located low on the eastern, western, and SSW flanks. Eruptive activity has in general migrated in a clockwise direction around the summit vent complex. More than 30 eruptions have been recorded from Gunung Kelut since 1000 CE. The ejection of water from the crater lake during the typically short but violent eruptions has created pyroclastic flows and lahars that have caused widespread fatalities and destruction. After more than 5000 people were killed during an eruption in 1919, an ambitious engineering project sought to drain the crater lake.

The inner 6.4 x 9.4 km wide caldera was formed about 20,150 years ago during eruption of the Gunungkawi Ignimbrite. The SE wall of the inner caldera lies beneath Lake Batur; Batur cone has been constructed within the inner caldera to a height above the outer caldera rim. The 1717-m-high Batur stratovolcano has produced vents over much of the inner caldera, but a NE-SW fissure system has localized the Batur I, II, and III craters along the summit ridge. Historical eruptions have been characterized by mild-to-moderate explosive activity sometimes accompanied by lava emission. Basaltic lava flows from both summit and flank vents have reached the caldera floor and the shores of Lake Batur in historical time.

The complex summit of the 1559-m-high volcano contains ten craters, some of which are lake filled, in a 5-sq-km area north of the city of Bajawa. The largest of these, Wolo Runu and Wolo Lega North, are 750 m wide. The first historical eruption of Inielika, a phreatic explosion that formed a new crater, did not occur until 1905 and was the volcano's only eruption during the 20th century.  Another eruption took place about a century later, in 2001. A chain of Pleistocene cinder cones, the Bajawa cinder cone complex, extends southward to Inierie.

Karangetang is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, with more than 40 eruptions recorded since 1675 and many additional small eruptions that were not documented in the historical record (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World: Neumann van Padang, 1951). Twentieth-century eruptions have included frequent explosive activity sometimes accompanied by pyroclastic flows and lahars. Lava dome growth has occurred in the summit craters; collapse of lava flow fronts has also produced pyroclastic flows.

The steep-sided, 1824-m-high andesitic-dacitic stratovolcano is surrounded by extensive, youthful pyroclastic-flow deposits that suggest parallels to Pinatubo volcano.  The summit of Parker is truncated by a 2.9-km-wide caldera with steep-sided walls that rise 200-500 m above heart-shaped Maughan Lake.  This volcano was unknown to most volcanologists until recent years, but it is now known to have been the source of a major explosive eruption in 1641 that was previously attributed to Awu volcano on Sangihe Island, Indonesia and caused darkness over the island of Mindanao.  The 1641 eruption included the emplacement of voluminous pyroclastic flows and lahars and resulted in the formation of the summit caldera.  This was the last of three major explosive eruptions from Parker during the last 3800 years.

Historical eruptions at this basaltic-andesitic volcano date back to 1616 and range from strombolian to basaltic plinian, with cyclical activity beginning with basaltic eruptions, followed by longer term andesitic lava flows. Eruptions occur predominately from the central conduit and have also produced lava flows that travel far down the flanks. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows have commonly swept down many of the approximately 40 ravines that radiate from the summit and have often devastated populated lowland areas. Mayon's most violent eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1200 people and devastated several towns.

Eruptions occur predominately from the central conduit and have also produced lava flows that travel far down the flanks. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows have commonly swept down many of the approximately 40 ravines that radiate from the summit and have often devastated populated lowland areas. Mayon's most violent eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1200 people and devastated several towns.

The circular summit crater is 1.5 km in diameter, with steep, 60-m-high walls.  Basaltic-andesite and basaltic lava effusion characterized the initial stage of volcanism during the early Pleistocene.  From about 600,000 to 300,000 years ago thick pyroclastic flows covered the entire volcano.  Recent periods of phreatomagmatic activity have produced ash flows.  The forested volcano is locally known as the "Mountain of Fire."  A phreatic explosion in 1860 may have been accompanied by a pyroclastic flow.  Strong solfataric activity occurred in 1907, and thermal areas are located near the summit crater and on the NW to NNE flanks.

Following construction of an andesitic volcano during the Pliocene, the subsidiary cones of Minabul to the north and Caanoan to the east were constructed on the northern part of the island.  The southern part of the island consists of three volcanic centers located along a SSE-NNW line, the andesitic Mount Camiguin stratovolcano and the young andesitic lava domes of Mt. Malabsing and Pamoctan.  A phreatic eruption, possibly in part submarine, was reported from Camiguin de Babuyanes around 1857.  Fumaroles are found on the SW, west, and east flanks of the volcano, and a boiling spring is located near sea level on the western flank of the volcano.

Kueishantao, also known as Guieshan Island, consists of andesitic lava flows and volcaniclastic material. It is the southwesternmost volcano along the axis of the Okinawa Trough back-arc basin that extends to the NE from Taiwan to Unzen volcano in Kyushu. The SW tip of the Okinawa Trough extends past Kueishantao onto the Ilao Plain on the island of Taiwan. The island is known as "Turtle Mountain Island" due to its profile as seen from some points on the coast of Taiwan. Historical accounts during the time of King Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty (1775-1795 CE) noted the Guieshan mountain split open with a blood-red lava flow. Kueishantao displays vigorous active submarine fumaroles and solfataras that discolor seawater over wide areas.

Suwanosejima, one of Japan's most frequently active volcanoes, was in a state of intermittent strombolian activity from Otake, the NE summit crater, that began in 1949 and lasted until 1996, after which periods of inactivity lengthened. The largest historical eruption took place in 1813-14, when thick scoria deposits blanketed residential areas, and the SW crater produced two lava flows that reached the western coast. At the end of the eruption the summit of Otake collapsed forming a large debris avalanche and creating the horseshoe-shaped Sakuchi caldera, which extends to the eastern coast. The island remained uninhabited for about 70 years after the 1813-1814 eruption. Lava flows reached the eastern coast of the island in 1884. Only about 50 persons live on the island.

Eruption of the voluminous Ito pyroclastic flow accompanied formation of the 17 x 23 km caldera about 22,000 years ago. The smaller Wakamiko caldera was formed during the early Holocene in the NE corner of the Aira caldera, along with several post-caldera cones. The construction of Sakurajima began about 13,000 years ago on the southern rim of Aira caldera and built an island that was finally joined to the Osumi Peninsula during the major explosive and effusive eruption of 1914. Activity at the Kitadake summit cone ended about 4850 years ago, after which eruptions took place at Minamidake.

A group of 17 central cones was constructed in the middle of the caldera, one of which, Nakadake, is one of Japan's most active volcanoes. It was the location of Japan's first documented historical eruption in 553 AD. The Nakadake complex has remained active throughout the Holocene. Several other cones have been active during the Holocene, including the Kometsuka scoria cone as recently as about 210 CE. Historical eruptions have largely consisted of basaltic to basaltic-andesite ash emission with periodic strombolian and phreatomagmatic activity. The summit crater of Nakadake is accessible by toll road and cable car, and is one of Kyushu's most popular tourist destinations.

It was the location of Japan's first documented historical eruption in 553 AD. The Nakadake complex has remained active throughout the Holocene. Several other cones have been active during the Holocene, including the Kometsuka scoria cone as recently as about 210 CE. Historical eruptions have largely consisted of basaltic to basaltic-andesite ash emission with periodic strombolian and phreatomagmatic activity. The summit crater of Nakadake is accessible by toll road and cable car, and is one of Kyushu's most popular tourist destinations.

These produced voluminous pyroclastic flows that covered much of Kyushu. The last of these, the Aso-4 eruption, produced more than 600 cu km of airfall tephra and pyroclastic-flow deposits. A group of 17 central cones was constructed in the middle of the caldera, one of which, Nakadake, is one of Japan's most active volcanoes. It was the location of Japan's first documented historical eruption in 553 AD. The Nakadake complex has remained active throughout the Holocene. Several other cones have been active during the Holocene, including the Kometsuka scoria cone as recently as about 210 CE.

It was the location of Japan's first documented historical eruption in 553 AD. The Nakadake complex has remained active throughout the Holocene. Several other cones have been active during the Holocene, including the Kometsuka scoria cone as recently as about 210 CE. Historical eruptions have largely consisted of basaltic to basaltic-andesite ash emission with periodic strombolian and phreatomagmatic activity. The summit crater of Nakadake is accessible by toll road and cable car, and is one of Kyushu's most popular tourist destinations.

Six major andesitic-to-dacitic tephra deposits, many associated with the growth of lava domes, have been recorded during the Holocene. Eruptive activity has migrated systematically eastward during the past 5000 years. The latest magmatic activity occurred about 1600 years ago, when Kurodake lava dome at the E end of the complex was formed. The first reports of historical eruptions were in the 17th and 18th centuries, when phreatic or hydrothermal activity occurred. There are also many hot springs and hydrothermal fields. A fumarole on Hosho lava dome was the site of a sulfur mine for at least 500 years. Two geothermal power plants are in operation at Kuju.

The calderas were formed as a result of two major explosive eruptions about 180,000 and 49,000-60,000 years ago. Scenic Lake Ashi lies between the SW caldera wall and a half dozen post-caldera lava domes that were constructed along a SW-NE trend cutting through the center of the calderas. Dome growth occurred progressively to the south, and the largest and youngest of these, Kamiyama, forms the high point of Hakoneyama. The calderas are breached to the east by the Hayakawa canyon. A phreatic explosion about 3000 years ago was followed by collapse of the NW side of Kamiyama, damming the Hayakawa valley and creating Lake Ashi. The latest magmatic eruptive activity about 2900 years ago produced a pyroclastic flow and a lava dome in the explosion crater, although phreatic eruptions took place as recently as the 12-13th centuries CE.  Seismic swarms have occurred during the 20th century. Lake Ashi, along with major thermal areas in the caldera, forms a popular resort area SW of Tokyo.

Ascending this volcano is one of the major objects of religious pilgrimage in central Japan. It is constructed within a largely buried 4 x 5 km caldera and occupies the southern end of the Norikura volcanic zone, which extends northward to Yakedake volcano. The older volcanic complex consisted of at least four major stratovolcanoes constructed from about 680,000 to about 420,000 years ago, after which Ontakesan was inactive for more than 300,000 years. The broad, elongated summit of the younger edifice is cut by a series of small explosion craters along a NNE-trending line. Several phreatic eruptions post-date the roughly 7300-year-old Akahoya tephra from Kikai caldera. The first historical eruption took place in 1979 from fissures near the summit. A non-eruptive landslide in 1984 produced a debris avalanche and lahar that swept down valleys south and east of the volcano. Very minor phreatic activity caused a dusting of ash near the summit in 1991 and 2007. A significant phreatic explosion in September 2014, when a large number of hikers were at or near the summit, resulted in many fatalities.

The small volcano rises to 2400 m and was constructed on a base of Tertiary mountains 2000 m high beginning about 3100 years ago. Three major magmatic eruptions took place in historical time, producing pyroclastic flows and surges and lava flows that traveled mainly down the Hayakawa river valley to the north and NW. The first of these eruptions took place about 1000 years ago (in 887 and possibly 989 CE) and produced the Hayakawa pyroclastic flow, which traveled about 20 km to reach the Japan Sea, and the massive Mae-yama lava flow, which traveled about 6.5 km down the Hayakawa river valley.

Maekake, capped by the Kamayama pyroclastic cone that forms the present summit, is probably only a few thousand years old and has an historical record dating back at least to the 11th century CE. Maekake has had several major plinian eruptions, the last two of which occurred in 1108 (Asamayama's largest Holocene eruption) and 1783 CE.

Growth of a dacitic shield volcano was accompanied by pumiceous pyroclastic flows, the largest of which occurred about 14,000-11,000 BP, and by growth of the Ko-Asama-yama lava dome on the east flank.  Maekake, capped by the Kamayama pyroclastic cone that forms the present summit, is probably only a few thousand years old and has an historical record dating back at least to the 11th century CE. Maekake has had several major plinian eruptions, the last two of which occurred in 1108 (Asamayama's largest Holocene eruption) and 1783 CE.

Growth of a dacitic shield volcano was accompanied by pumiceous pyroclastic flows, the largest of which occurred about 14,000-11,000 BP, and by growth of the Ko-Asama-yama lava dome on the east flank.  Maekake, capped by the Kamayama pyroclastic cone that forms the present summit, is probably only a few thousand years old and has an historical record dating back at least to the 11th century CE. Maekake has had several major plinian eruptions, the last two of which occurred in 1108 (Asamayama's largest Holocene eruption) and 1783 CE.

The modern Maekake cone forms the summit and is situated east of the horseshoe-shaped remnant of an older andesitic volcano, Kurofuyama, which was destroyed by a late-Pleistocene landslide about 20,000 years before present (BP).  Growth of a dacitic shield volcano was accompanied by pumiceous pyroclastic flows, the largest of which occurred about 14,000-11,000 BP, and by growth of the Ko-Asama-yama lava dome on the east flank.  Maekake, capped by the Kamayama pyroclastic cone that forms the present summit, is probably only a few thousand years old and has an historical record dating back at least to the 11th century CE. Maekake has had several major plinian eruptions, the last two of which occurred in 1108 (Asamayama's largest Holocene eruption) and 1783 CE.

The NE rim of an 8-km-wide Pleistocene caldera forms an arcuate ridge across a flat caldera-floor moat NE of the Hakkoda group volcanoes, which bury the SE caldera wall. A northern group of volcanoes, constructed within the caldera, appears to be younger than the southern group. Hakkoda-Odake, Ido-dake, and Tsurugi-dake have well-preserved craters. Akakura-dake has a 1-km-wide explosion crater breached to the north. No historical eruptions are known, although an active solfatara occurs at Ido-dake, and hot springs are found at several locations within the caldera. Three minor phreatic eruptions were documented from Jigoku-numa on the SW flank of Odake volcano from the 13th-17th centuries. Three soldiers on a training mission in July 1997 were killed by inhalation of volcanic gas.

Dissected lava domes ring the caldera floor. The andesitic-to-dacitic volcano is largely Pleistocene in age, with activity dating back about 800,000 years. The last identified distal tephra deposit was erupted during the late Pleistocene. The only report of historical activity was in a Tohoku district travel document published in 1787, which stated that Yakeyama in Mutsu country (Osoreyama) had erupted. Older residents reported that large fires and clouds were sometimes seen from the summit, accounting for the volcano's local name, Yakeyama, or "Burning Mountain" (Murayama, 1987).  Earthquake swarms have been documented during the second half of the 20th century, and magma bodies have been detected beneath the volcano.

The steep NE flank of the 857-m-high volcano terminates in high sea cliffs. The gentler SW flanks have low-angle slopes bounded by sea cliffs only a few meters high. The southern flank is cut by a large landslide scar. The southern flanks and western flanks are mantled by ash deposits that may have originated during eruptions in historical time. An explosive eruption in 1906 also produced lava flows that descended about half way down the western and SE flanks, but several other historical eruption reports are of uncertain validity. Few invesitgations have been done on the Cheref and Poyo seamounts, 30 and 50 km SE, respectively.

The latter has three coalescing cones and a breached summit crater that fed lava flows to the west and NW.  The 287-m high point of the island is the south rim of the caldera.  Freycinet misidentifed Guguan with Alamagan; reported eruptions in 1819 and 1901 (Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World) actually refer to solfataric activity on Alamagan (Corwin, 1971).  The only known historical eruption of Guguan took place between 1882 and 1884 and produced the northern volcano and lava flows that reached the coast.

Ponded lava flows overlain by pyroclastic deposits fill the floor of the western caldera, whose SW side is cut by a fresh-looking smaller crater. The 2-km-wide eastern portion of the caldera contained a steep-walled inner crater whose floor prior to the 2003 eruption was only 68 m above sea level. A submarine cone, named NE Anatahan, rises to within 460 m of the sea surface on the NE flank, and numerous other submarine vents are found on the NE-to-SE flanks. Sparseness of vegetation on the most recent lava flows had indicated that they were of Holocene age, but the first historical eruption did not occur until May 2003, when a large explosive eruption took place forming a new crater inside the eastern caldera.

These volcanoes overlap the SW rim and SW caldera floor of the Pleistocene Tokachimitsumata caldera. The highest peak in the complex is 2013-m-high Nipesotsuyama stratovolcano, which was active during the mid-Pleistocene, about 0.4-0.2 million years ago. The Maruyama stratovolcano and lava dome at the southern end of the complex was discovered to be a Quaternary volcano only in 1989. It is also referred to as Higashi-Tokachi-Maruyama to distinguish it from several other volcanoes named Maruyama, which means "Round Mountain."  A minor phreatic eruption took place at Maruyama lava dome in 1898, and fumaroles are present on one of its summit craters.

It consists of a complex group of stratovolcanoes and lava domes associated with a small, 2-km-wide caldera. The eight satellitic volcanoes are aligned along a ring fracture that is centered over the eastern rim of the caldera.  Asahi-dake, the highest peak of the complex, was constructed 3 km SW of the center of the caldera. Other stratovolcanoes are located along a NE-SW line cutting through the caldera that trends toward the Tokachi volcano complex to the SW. In contrast to the Tokachi group, no historical eruptions are known, although the latest phreatic eruption took place sometime after 1739 AD. Fumarolic areas are located on Asahidake, where at one time sulfur was mined, and in the caldera.

The 1660-m-high volcano is located along a ridge 5 km SW of Shiretoko-Iozan volcano, the NE-most Holocene volcano in Hokkaido. Young lava flows descend the NW flank and broad areas along the SE flank, and an older lava flow traveled about 9 km W, reaching the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk along a broad front. Eruptions produced pumiceous tephras with associated pyroclastic flows about 2200, 1400, and 800 years ago. Recent work has documented a pyroclastic-flow deposit that overlies the 1739 tephra from Tarumai volcano in SW Hokkaido. Stratigraphic relationships place this eruption, the most recent known from Rausudake, between about 1750 and 1850 CE.

Explosive activity has dominated in the formation of this andesitic-dacitic volcano; no lava flows are exposed. The gently sloping stratovolcano, is truncated by a 4-5 km wide caldera that formed during a series of late-Pleistocene eruptions beginning about 43,00 years ago. Several lava domes were subsequently emplaced on the caldera floor. Topographic highs outside the caldera rim define a series of lava domes extruded along a ring structure or an outer caldera. A 1 x 2.5 km caldera lake on the northern side of the inner caldera drains through a narrow breach in the western caldera wall. Solfataric activity occurs at the northern lake shore and at explosion craters (one of which contains a hot crater lake with reported temperatures from 36-100 degrees C) that cut the caldera-floor lava domes.  The only known historical eruption was a minor explosion in 1848.

The dominantly andesitic-dacitic volcano is cut by two nested calderas, the larger 6-7 km in diameter and the smaller 3-3.5 km. A central cone that formed inside the younger caldera was breached to the west by a large debris avalanche about 4200 years ago. A lava dome that grew inside the avalanche scarp forms the 888 m high point of the volcano. Additional lava domes in the northern part of the older caldera are considered to represent flank activity of the younger caldera. The only unambiguous historical eruption was a small phreatic explosion in 1880. Four solfatara fields lie at the eastern and northern flanks of the central cone, and a geothermal field is located outside the caldera along the eastern coast.

Historically active Moyorodake is younger than 2000 years; it and Tukap remain fumarolically active. The westernmost of the post-caldera cones, Menshoi Brat, is a large lava dome with flank scoria cones, one of which has produced a series of young lava flows up to 4.5 km long that reached Slavnoe Lake. Eruptions have been documented since the 18th century, although lava flows from cinder cones on the flanks of Menshoi Brat were also probably erupted within the past few centuries.

The symmetrical Cherny volcano, which forms the 691 m high point of the island, erupted twice during the 18th and 19th centuries. The youngest volcano, Snow, originated between 1770 and 1810. It is composed almost entirely of lava flows, many of which have reached the sea on the southern coast. No historical eruptions are known from 742-m-high Brat Chirpoev, but its youthful morphology suggests recent strombolian activity.

Evidence of additional slope failures followed by plinian eruptions are found in sea cliffs of the island. Historical explosive eruptions have occurred since the early 18th century. A central cone, Severgin, was largely destroyed during the 1933 eruption, one of the largest in the Kuril Islands during historical time. Impact of a debris avalanche into the sea from the collapse of Severgin produced a tsunami that swept the island's coast and reached Onekotan and Paramushir Islands, killing two persons. A large lava dome emplaced during the 1933 eruption now fills the head of the eastern crater.

The basaltic-to-andesitic caldera is filled by the deep-blue 7-km-wide Kal'tsevoe lake, whose surface is 400 m above sea level.  The caldera was formed about 7500 years ago during one of the largest Holocene eruptions in the Kuril Islands.  A large symmetrical post-caldera cone, 1325-m-high andesitic Krenitzyn Peak, forms a 4-km wide island that towers high above the caldera rim and fills the NW portion of the caldera lake.  A 350-m-wide, 100-m-deep crater truncates the peak and a large lateral crater is located on the upper NE side.  The only historical eruption of Krenitzyn Peak, in 1952, formed a small, mostly lacustral lava dome in an explosion crater along the east shore of the island.

A third 5-km-wide caldera formed about 25,000 years ago by collapse of an interglacial cone that was constructed over the glaciated surfaces of the earlier calderas.  The 1018-m-high central cone of Nemo Peak is composed of two coalescing andesitic cones that were constructed at the SW side of the youngest caldera and formed in four stages beginning in the early Holocene about 9500 years ago.  Construction of the central cone has left the crescent-shaped Chernoe Lake at the NE end of the youngest caldera; lava flows from Nemo Peak form the broad SW shoreline of the lake.  The final activity built a lava dome that completely overtops a 350-m-wide crater and has a 150-m-wide crater at its summit.  Historical eruptions of Nemo Peak date back to the early-18th century.

The volcano rises 2800 m from the floor of the Sea of Okhotsk to a height of 1742 m. This isolated symmetrical andesitic stratovolcano has a 700-m-wide, steep-walled crater that is 300 m deep. A deep notch cuts the NW rim of the crater to the level of the crater floor, at the head of a canyon that reaches the coast. Well-preserved lava flows occupy the middle and lower flanks, particularly on the E and SE sides. Only one unambiguous historical eruption, in 1854, is known. Reports of eruptions in 1737, 1793, 1857, and 1859 are false (Gorshkov, 1970). Murayama (1987) also listed an eruption in 1742 (only earthquakes and a tsunami are cited by Sapper, 1917) and "smoke" emission in 1933.

The modern edifice grew within a 4-km-wide caldera produced by collapse of an earlier volcano creating large debris avalanches at about the time of formation of the adjacent Kurile Lake caldera. A period of strong silicic explosive volcanism during the mid-Holocene lasted about 800 years. A series of youthful lava flows cover much of the northern flanks. Growth of the modern cone was completed about 1900 years ago, after which a long quiescent period began. The only recorded historical eruption, in 1901, produced a large 1-km-wide crater on the NE flank.

It is a large, low-angle stratovolcano, constructed of alternating basaltic-andesitic lavas and dacitic pyroclastics, and is truncated by an intricate complex of five calderas. An array of post-caldera structures is truncated by later calderas, the last three of which formed during the Holocene, about 7900 and 5000 BCE and about 240 CE. The latter eruption was the second largest in Kamchatka during the Holocene, and produced about 20 cu km of rhyodacitic airfall tephra and 3-4 cu km of pyroclastic flows. The eastern part of the caldera complex contains two lakes, the northern of which forms an embayment in Stubel Crater, a low-angle cone that began forming about 1600 years ago in the youngest caldera. The only historical eruption, in 1907, originated from Stubel Crater and was one of Kamchatka's largest in historical time.

Avachinsky began to form during the middle or late Pleistocene and is flanked to the SE by the parasitic volcano Kozelsky, which has a large crater breached to the NE. It has a large horseshoe-shaped caldera, breached to the SW, that was formed when a major debris avalanche about 30,000-40,000 years ago buried an area of about 500 sq km to the south underlying the city of Petropavlovsk. Reconstruction of the volcano took place in two stages, the first of which began about 18,000 years before present (BP), and the second 7000 years BP. Most eruptive products have been explosive, with pyroclastic flows and hot lahars being directed primarily to the SW by the breached caldera, although relatively short lava flows have been emitted. The frequent historical eruptions have been similar in style and magnitude to previous Holocene eruptions.

Beliankin stratovolcano, in the SW part of Polovinka caldera, is eroded, but has been active in postglacial time (Sviatlovsky, 1959).  Two nested calderas,  5 x 4 km Odnoboky and 3 x 5 km Akademia Nauk (also known as Karymsky Lake or Academii Nauk), were formed during the late Pleistocene, the latter about 30,000 years ago.  Eruptive products varied from initial basaltic-andesite lava flows to late-stage rhyodacitic lava domes.  Two maars, Akademia Nauk and Karymsky, subsequently formed at the southern and northern margins of the caldera lake, respectively.  The northern maar, Karymsky, erupted about 6500 radiocarbon years ago and formed a small bay.  The first historical eruption from Akademia Nauk did not take place until January 2, 1996, when a brief, day-long explosive eruption of unusual basaltic and rhyolitic composition occurred from vents beneath the NNW part of the caldera lake near Karymsky maar.

The summit consists of overlapping lava domes, and blocky lava flows descend the flanks of the volcano, which is the westernmost of a volcanic chain north of Kronotsky volcano. The 2334-m-high edifice was formed during four eruptive cycles beginning about 12,000 years ago and lasting 2000-3500 years. The largest eruptions took place about 10,000 and 8300-8400 years ago, and three periods of long-term lava dome growth have occurred. The latest eruptive cycle began about 3000 years ago with a large explosion and was followed by intermittent lava dome growth lasting about 1000 years. An explosive eruption about 1100 years ago produced a lateral blast and created a 1.0 x 0.7 km wide crater breached to the NE, inside which a small lava dome (the fourth at Kizimen) has grown. Prior to 2010, only a single explosive eruption, during 1927-28, had been recorded in historical time.

An explosive eruption about 1100 years ago produced a lateral blast and created a 1.0 x 0.7 km wide crater breached to the NE, inside which a small lava dome (the fourth at Kizimen) has grown. Prior to 2010, only a single explosive eruption, during 1927-28, had been recorded in historical time.

The modern volcano, much smaller in size than its massive neighbors Kamen and Kliuchevskoi, was formed about 4700 years ago over a late-Pleistocene lava-dome complex and an ancestral edifice built about 11,000-7000 years ago. Three periods of intensified activity have occurred during the past 3000 years. The latest period, which was preceded by a 1000-year quiescence, began with the dramatic 1955-56 eruption. This eruption, similar to that of St. Helens in 1980, produced a large horseshoe-shaped crater that was formed by collapse of the summit and an associated lateral blast. Subsequent episodic but ongoing lava-dome growth, accompanied by intermittent explosive activity and pyroclastic flows, has largely filled the 1956 crater.

The 1730-m-high Mount Cleveland is the highest of the Islands of the Four Mountains group and is one of the most active of the Aleutian Islands. The native name for Mount Cleveland, Chuginadak, refers to the Aleut goddess of fire, who was thought to reside on the volcano. Numerous large lava flows descend the steep-sided flanks. It is possible that some 18th-to-19th century eruptions attributed to Carlisle should be ascribed to Cleveland (Miller et al., 1998). In 1944 Cleveland produced the only known fatality from an Aleutian eruption.

Amak is located about 50 km NW of Frosty volcano on the western tip of the Alaska Peninsula.  The summit of the small, roughly 1 cu km Amak volcano is only 488 m above sea level.  Blocky lava flows with prominent levees were emplaced during historical eruptions from 1700-1710 and in 1796 (Marsh, in Wood and Kienle 1990).  The flows radiate from a well-defined central crater and cover much of the central part of the island.  Earlier volcanism perhaps 4000-5000 years ago consisted of the emission of thin, platy andesitic lava flows.  A flat alluvial plain on the south flank contains a flat-bottomed crater that may be a maar.

Satellitic lava domes occur high on the NW and SE flanks of the glacier-mantled volcano.  An unglaciated lava flow and an overlying pyroclastic-flow deposit extending east from the summit are the most recent products of Chiginagak.  They most likely originated from a lava dome at 1687 m on the SE flank, 1 km from the summit of the volcano, which has variably been estimated to be from 2075 to 2221 m high.  Brief ash eruptions were reported in July 1971 and August 1998.  Fumarolic activity occurs at 1600 m elevation on the NE flank of the volcano, and two areas of hot-spring travertine deposition are located at the NW base of the volcano near Volcano Creek.

Late-Pleistocene caldera formation at Ugashik volcano was followed by the emplacement of at least 5 Holocene lava domes within the 4.5-km-wide caldera.  Most of the caldera walls consist of basement sandstones of Jurassic age.  Following caldera formation the small, 3 cu km Peulik stratovolcano grew 2.5 km to the north to a height of 1474 m, more than 500 m above that of Ugashik.  Lava flows from Peulik cover the caldera rim to the south and extend to Becharof Lake, 6 km to the north.  A small lava dome at 1200 m elevation on the east flank of Peulik was the source of a small block-and-ash flow.  The summit of Peulik volcano contains a 1.5-km-wide crater breached to the west that is partially filled by a lava dome.  Debris-avalanche deposits cover a 75 sq km area to the NW.  A single documented historical eruption took place from Peulik volcano in 1814.

Eruptions migrated through time from the NE to the SW. In 1953 a new lava dome began growing on the SW flank of Trident I volcano. A series of thick andesitic lava flows were erupted between 1953 and 1968, forming a cone with 400-800 m of local relief. Periodic explosions took place until 1974, and the current summit contains a 350-m-wide crater. Some of the distal lava flows from West Trident stratovolcano collapsed into the Novarupta vent during its 1912 eruption.

Two or more large explosive eruptions took place from Mount Katmai during the late Pleistocene.  Most of the two overlapping pre-1912 Katmai volcanoes are Pleistocene in age, but Holocene lava flows from a flank vent descend the SE flank of the SW stratovolcano into the Katmai River canyon.  Katmai was initially considered to be the source of the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes ash flow in 1912.  However, the 3 x 4 km wide caldera of 1912 is now known to have formed as a result of the voluminous eruption at nearby Novarupta volcano.  The steep walled young caldera has a jagged rim that rises 500-1000 m above the caldera floor and contains a 250-m-deep, still-rising lake.   Lake waters have covered a small post-collapse lava dome (Horseshoe Island) that was seen on the caldera floor at the time of the initial ascent to the caldera rim in 1916.  Post-1912 glaciers have formed on a bench within Katmai caldera.

More than 90% of the compound Snowy volcano is mantled by glacial ice, which prompted the naming of the volcano by members of  the 1917 Katmai expedition.  Two small andesitic-dacitic stratovolcanoes, SW Snowy and NE Snowy, originated about 200,000 years ago.  Only NE Snowy has been active during the Holocene.   Late-Holocene collapse of this volcano produced a large debris avalanche that traveled to the north and left a large breached crater inside which a blocky lava dome was constructed.  Peat beneath an ash layer thought to be associated with the the lava dome was radiocarbon dated at about 250 +/- 70 years ago.  No historical eruptive activity has been documented, but fumarolic activity has been observed at NE Snowy.  A zone of persistent diffuse shallow seismicity is located on and NW of the volcano.

The orientation of andesitic lava flows and extensive hydrothermal alteration of rocks near the present 2105-m-high summit suggest that it probably marks the vent of Fourpeaked volcano.  Eruptive activity during the Holocene had not been confirmed prior to the first historical eruption of Fourpeaked in September 2006.  A N-trending fissure extending 1 km from the summit produced minor ashfall.

Large Holocene mudflows from collapse of this massive, heavily glaciated andesitic volcano have reached as far as the Puget Sound lowlands.  The present summit was constructed within a large crater breached to the northeast formed by collapse of the volcano during a major explosive eruption about 5600 years that produced the widespread Osceola Mudflow.  Rainier has produced eruptions throughout the Holocene, including about a dozen during the past 2600 years; the largest of these occurred about 2200 years ago.  The present-day summit cone is capped by two overlapping craters.  Extensive hydrothermal alteration of the upper portion of the volcano has contributed to its structural weakness; an active thermal system has caused periodic melting on flank glaciers and produced an elaborate system of steam caves in the summit icecap.  Reported 19th-century eruptions have not left identifiable deposits, but a phreatic eruption may have taken place as recently as 1894.

A series of eruptions from Lassen Peak from 1914 to 1917 marks the most recent eruptive activity in the southern Cascade Range.  Activity spanning about 825,000 years began with eruptions of the Rockland caldera complex and was followed beginning about 590,000 years ago by construction of Brokeoff stratovolcano.  Beginning about 310,000 years ago activity shifted to the north flank of Brokeoff, where episodic, more silicic eruptions produced the Lassen dome field, a group of 30 dacitic lava domes including Bumpass Mountain, Mount Helen, Ski Heil Peak, and Reading Peak.  At least 12 eruptive episodes took place during the past 100,000 years, with Lassen Peak being constructed about 27,000 years ago.  The Chaos Crags dome complex was constructed about 1100-1000 years ago north of Lassen Peak.  The Cinder Cone complex NE of Lassen Peak was erupted in a single episode several hundred years before present and is considered part of the Lassen volcanic center (Clynne et al., 2000).  The 1914-1917 eruptions of Lassen Peak began with phreatic eruptions and included emplacement of a small summit lava dome, subplinian explosions, mudflows, and pyroclastic flows.

A series of eruptions from Lassen Peak from 1914 to 1917 marks the most recent eruptive activity in the southern Cascade Range.  Activity spanning about 825,000 years began with eruptions of the Rockland caldera complex and was followed beginning about 590,000 years ago by construction of Brokeoff stratovolcano.  Beginning about 310,000 years ago activity shifted to the north flank of Brokeoff, where episodic, more silicic eruptions produced the Lassen dome field, a group of 30 dacitic lava domes including Bumpass Mountain, Mount Helen, Ski Heil Peak, and Reading Peak.  At least 12 eruptive episodes took place during the past 100,000 years, with Lassen Peak being constructed about 27,000 years ago.

The complex stratovolcano rises above the floor of the Tepic graben and is truncated by two concentric summit calderas.  Eruption of the voluminous rhyodacitic Jala Pumice, the largest known in México during the Holocene, formed the initial 4-km-wide caldera about 1000 years ago.  The second caldera, 1.5 km wide, was formed by collapse of part of the large Dos Equis dacitic lava dome, which partly filled the earlier caldera.  About 15 basaltic and andesitic cinder cones and lava flows have erupted along a NW-SE-trending line cutting across Ceboruco.  The massive, sparsely vegetated El Norte lava flow, probably erupted in the past few hundred years, blankets the entire northern flank of the volcano.  The last eruption of Ceboruco took place during 1870-75.  Explosive eruptions from a vent on the upper west flank accompanied extrusion of a 1.1 cu km dacitic lava flow that covers a large area on the lower western flank.

A group of cinder cones of late-Pleistocene age is located on the floor of the Colima graben west and east of the Colima complex. Volcán de Colima (also known as Volcán Fuego) is a youthful stratovolcano constructed within a 5-km-wide caldera, breached to the south, that has been the source of large debris avalanches. Major slope failures have occurred repeatedly from both the Nevado and Colima cones, and have produced a thick apron of debris-avalanche deposits on three sides of the complex. Frequent historical eruptions date back to the 16th century. Occasional major explosive eruptions (most recently in 1913) have destroyed the summit and left a deep, steep-sided crater that was slowly refilled and then overtopped by lava dome growth.

The volcano rises 1800 m above deeply dissected plutonic and metamorphic terrain. Three large calderas breached to the south, and the elongated summit region is dominated by a series of lava domes intruded along a NE-SW trend. Volcanism has migrated to the SW, and a small adventive lava dome is located in the crater of the youngest volcano, San Antonio, on the upper SW flank. Viscous lava flow complexes are found on the north and south flanks, and lobate lahar deposits fill many valleys. Radial drainages on the Guatemalan side are deflected by surrounding mountains into the Pacific coastal plain on the SW side of the volcano. Historical activity has been restricted to mild phreatic eruptions, but more powerful explosive activity, including the production of pyroclastic flows, has occurred as recently as about 1950 years ago.

The 3535-m-high summit directly overlies the inferred margin of the Pleistocene Atitlán III caldera and is the highest of three large post-caldera stratovolcanoes constructed near the southern caldera rim. The volcano consequently post-dates the eruption of the voluminous, roughly 85,000-year-old rhyolitic Los Chocoyos tephra associated with formation of the Atitlán III caldera.

The summit of Boquerón is truncated by a steep-walled crater 1.5 km wide and about 500 m deep that formed during a major eruption about 800 years ago. It contained a crater lake prior to an eruption during 1917 that formed a small cinder cone on the crater floor; a major north-flank lava flow also erupted in this year. Three fracture zones that extend beyond the base of San Salvador volcano have been the locus for numerous flank eruptions, including two that formed maars on the WNW and SE sides.

The 872-m-high stratovolcano forms a large peninsula extending into the Gulf of Fonseca at the western tip of the country.  Cosigüina (also spelled Cosegüina) has a pronounced somma rim on the northern side; a young summit cone of Cosigüina rises 300 m above the northern somma rim and buries the rim on other sides.  The younger cone is truncated by a large elliptical prehistorical summit caldera, 2 x 2.4 km in diameter and 500 m deep, with a lake at its bottom.  Lava flows predominate in the caldera walls, although lahar and pyroclastic-flow deposits surround the volcano.  In 1835 Cosigüina was the source of a brief, but powerful explosive eruption that was Nicaragua's largest during historical time.  Ash fell as far away as México, Costa Rica, and Jamaica, and pyroclastic flows reached the Gulf of Fonseca.

The caldera was formed during several major explosive eruptions that produced voluminous dacitic-rhyolitic pyroclastic flows between about 1.5 and 0.6 million years ago.  Growth of post-caldera volcanoes in the eastern part of the caldera that overtopped much of the eastern and southern caldera rims was interrupted by edifice collapse that produced a major debris avalanche to the SW.  Morphologically youthful lava flows cover the western and SW flanks of the post-caldera Miravalles complex, which rises above the town of Guayabo on the flat western caldera floor.  The only reported historical eruptive activity was a small steam explosion on the SW flank in 1946.  High heat flow remains, and Miravalles is the site of the largest developed geothermal field in Costa Rica.

The southernmost of the two summit crater lakes, Botos, is cold and clear and last erupted about 7500 years ago. The more prominent geothermally heated northern lake, Laguna Caliente, is one of the world's most acidic natural lakes, with a pH of near zero. It has been the site of frequent phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions since the first historical eruption was reported in 1828. Eruptions often include geyser-like ejections of crater-lake water.

No lava flows have been identified from Irazú since the eruption of the massive Cervantes lava flows from south-flank vents about 14,000 years ago, and all known Holocene eruptions have been explosive.  The focus of eruptions at the summit crater complex has migrated to the west towards the historically active crater, which contains a small lake of variable size and color.  Although eruptions may have occurred around the time of the Spanish conquest, the first well-documented historical eruption occurred in 1723, and frequent explosive eruptions have occurred since.  Ashfall from the last major eruption of Irazú during 1963-65 caused significant disruption to San José and surrounding areas.

Baru	11256	346010	Stratovolcano	Caldera	Lava dome	NAN	NAN	NAN	Subduction zone / Continental crust (> 25 km)	Andesite / Basaltic Andesite	Panama	Confirmed Eruption	1550	0	0	NAN	NAN	NAN	NAN	NAN	NAN	8.808	-82.543	3474	The westernmost volcano in Panamá, Barú, is a complex dominantly andesitic stratovolcano in the Talamanca Range near the Costa Rica border. The forested 3474-m-high volcano (also referred to as Volcán de Chiriqui) is the highest peak in Panamá, and the summit now bristles with communication towers. A large 6-km-wide summit caldera breached widely to the west was formed by a large volcanic landslide, which created a massive debris-avalanche deposit about 9000 years ago that extends onto the Pacific coastal plain, largely overlying deposits of an earlier late-Pleistocene debris avalanche. Post-collapse eruptions have constructed lava domes inside the caldera that have grown to a height exceeding that of the caldera rim. A strong explosive eruption at about 700 CE ended human occupation at the Cerro Punta archaeological site NW of the volcano.  Montessus de Ballore (1884) reported a strong eruption at Barú in the mid-16th century. Sapper (1917) considered this report to be uncertain, but radiocarbon dates subsequently imply tephra deposits younger than about 500 years. Volcán Barú is the youngest major volcano in Panamá, and geothermal exploration projects have been undertaken to determine its energy potential.

The andesitic-dacitic younger Tolima formed during the past 40,000 years, rising above and largely obscuring a 3-km-wide late-Pleistocene caldera. The summit consists of a cluster of late-Pleistocene to Holocene lava domes that were associated with thick block-lava flows on the N and E flanks, and extensive pyroclastic-flow deposits. The summit contains a funnel-shaped crater 200-300 m deep. Holocene activity has included explosive eruptions ranging in size from moderate to plinian. The last major eruption took place about 3600 years ago. Lava dome growth has produced block-and-ash flows that traveled primarily to the NE and SE. Minor explosive eruptions have been recorded in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The 5364-m-high andesitic-dacitic volcano, the highest peak in the Colombian Andes, was constructed within a 10-km-wide caldera.  Volcanism at Nevado del Huila has produced six volcanic cones whose ages in general migrated from south to north.  The high point of the complex is Pico Central.  Two glacier-free lava domes lie at the southern end of the Huila volcanic complex.  The first historical eruption from this little known volcano was an explosive eruption in the mid-16th century.  Long-term, persistent steam columns had risen from Pico Central prior to the next eruption in 2007, when explosive activity was accompanied by damaging mudflows.

Long-term extensive hydrothermal alteration has contributed to large-scale edifice collapse on at least three occasions, producing debris avalanches that swept to the west and left a large horseshoe-shaped caldera inside which the modern cone has been constructed. Major explosive eruptions since the mid-Holocene have produced widespread tephra deposits and pyroclastic flows that swept all but the southern flanks. A central cone slightly lower than the caldera rim has been the site of numerous small-to-moderate historical eruptions since the time of the Spanish conquistadors.

The volcano is elongated in a NE-SW direction and is composed primarily of andesitic-dacitic lava flows.  Two fumarolically active craters occupy the summit ridge; the main crater on the NE side and Mundo Nuevo crater on the SW side.  A young lava dome occupies the 250-m-wide summit crater, and eruptions from the upper east flank produced a 6-km-long lava field.  The oldest crater lies NNE of the summit crater, suggesting SW-ward migration of activity.  Explosive eruptions in 1877 and 1926 are the only known historical activity from Cumbal.  Fumarole fields are found in the two summit craters, and thermal springs are located on the SE flanks.

The 5790-m-high volcano, whose southern flank lies astride the equator, is capped by extensive glaciers, which descend to 4200 m on the eastern Amazonian side.  The modern Nevado Cayambe volcano, constructed to the east of older Pleistocene volcanic complexes, contains two summit lava domes located about 1.5 km apart, the western of which is the highest.  Several other lava domes on the upper flanks have been the source of pyroclastic flows that reached the lower flanks of the volcano.  A prominent Holocene pyroclastic cone on the lower eastern flank, La Virgen, fed thick andesitic lava flows that traveled about 10 km to the east.  Nevado Cayambe was recently discovered to have produced frequent explosive eruptions during the Holocene beginning about 4000 years ago, and to have had a single historical eruption, during 1785-86.

Tungurahua II was built within the past 14,000 years following the collapse of the initial edifice. Tungurahua II itself collapsed about 3000 years ago and produced a large debris-avalanche deposit and a horseshoe-shaped caldera open to the west, inside which the modern glacier-capped stratovolcano (Tungurahua III) was constructed. Historical eruptions have all originated from the summit crater, accompanied by strong explosions and sometimes by pyroclastic flows and lava flows that reached populated areas at the volcano's base.

The growth and destruction of Ubinas I was followed by construction of Ubinas II beginning in the mid-Pleistocene. The upper slopes of the andesitic-to-rhyolitic Ubinas II stratovolcano are composed primarily of andesitic and trachyandesitic lava flows and steepen to nearly 45 degrees.

Solfataric activity was noted in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World. Based on morphological evidence, de Silva and Francis (1990) suggested that reported historical eruptions in the 18th and 19th centuries (listed in the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World) more likely originated from the more youthful-looking Yucamane volcano.

It is the youngest and most southerly of a NE-SW-trending chain of volcanoes.  Irruputuncu was constructed within the collapse scarp of a Holocene debris avalanche whose deposit extends to the SW.   Subsequent eruptions filled much of this scarp and produced thick, viscous lava flows down the western flank.  The summit complex contains two craters, the southernmost of which is fumarolically active.  The first unambiguous historical eruption from Irruputuncu took place in November 1995, when phreatic explosions produced dark ash clouds.

Andesitic-dacitic lava flows extend as far as 5 km N from the active crater of Volcán Olca and to the north and west from vents farther to the west. Olca is flanked on the west by Cerro Michincha and on the east by Volcán Paruma, which is immediately west of the higher pre-Holocene Cerro Paruma volcano. Volcán Paruma has been the source of conspicuous fresh lava flows, one of which extends 7 km SE. Volcán Paruma has displayed persistent fumarolic activity in recent years. The only known historical activity from the complex was a flank eruption of unspecified character between 1865 and 1867.

An older, higher stratovolcano 5 km E, Volcán Aguas Calientes, displays a well-developed summit crater and a probable Holocene lava flow near its summit (de Silva and Francis, 1991). Láscar consists of two major edifices; activity began at the eastern volcano and then shifted to the western cone. The largest eruption took place about 26,500 years ago, and following the eruption of the Tumbres scoria flow about 9000 years ago, activity shifted back to the eastern edifice, where three overlapping craters were formed. Frequent small-to-moderate explosive eruptions have been recorded since the mid-19th century, along with periodic larger eruptions that produced ashfall hundreds of kilometers away. The largest historical eruption took place in 1993, producing pyroclastic flows to 8.5 km NW of the summit and ashfall in Buenos Aires.

The complex was constructed during three eruptive cycles dating back to the middle Pleistocene.  The latest activity produced a series of youthful small stratovolcanoes and craters, of which the youngest appear to be Tinguiririca and Fray Carlos.  Constant fumarolic activity occurs within and on the NW wall of the summit crater of Tinguiririca, and hot springs and fumaroles with sulfur deposits are found on the western flanks of the summit cones.  A single historical eruption from Tinguiririca was recorded in 1917.

Activity began in the Pleistocene with construction of the basaltic-andesite to dacitic Volcán Azufre, followed by formation of basaltic and basaltic-andesite Volcán Planchón, 6 km to the north. About 11,500 years ago, much of Azufre and part of Planchón collapsed, forming the massive Río Teno debris avalanche, which traveled 95 km to reach Chile's Central Valley.  Subsequently, Volcán Planchón II was formed. The youngest volcano, andesitic and basaltic-andesite Volcán Peteroa, consists of scattered vents between Azufre and Planchón. Peteroa has been active into historical time and contains a small steaming crater lake.

Along with 3788-m-high Cerro Azul, only 7 km to the south, 3953-m-high Descabezado Grande lies at the center of a 20 x 30 km volcanic field.  A lateral crater that formed on the upper NNE flank in 1932, shortly after the end of the major 1932 eruption from nearby Quizapu volcano on the north flank of Cerro Azul, was the site of the only historical eruption of Descabezado Grande.  The Holocene Alto de las Mulas fissure on the lower NW flank of Descabezado Grande produced young rhyodacitic lava flows.  Numerous small late-Pleistocene to Holocene volcanic centers are located north of the volcano.  The northernmost of these, Lengua de Vulcano (or Mondaca) produced a very youthful rhyodacitic lava flow that dammed the Río Lentué.

The 1758-m-high, ice-covered volcano lies about 200 km NW of the town of Punta Arenas.  Monte Burney was constructed on the western rim of a 6-km-wide caldera, which is partially filled with and surrounded by an unglaciated pyroclastic-flow deposit.  Flank vents produced andesitic-dacitic lava flows and pyroclastic material.  Collapse of the edifice produced a major debris avalanche that traveled to the SSW.  Two large plinian eruptions have been documented from Monte Burney during the Holocene.  The only known historical eruption of Monte Burney took place in 1910.

One of the cones, south of Bahía del Volcán, contains a 150-m-wide crater with a small lake.  The lava domes and pyroclastic cones, possibly emplaced along N-S-trending faults, are unaffected by glacial erosion that scoured the underlying plutonic rocks.  Passing navigators observed possible eruptive activity in the direction of Cook in 1712 and the eruption of incandescent ejecta in 1820.

Its eruptive history is characterized by the emplacement of lava domes and associated pyroclastic flows.  The summit of the volcano, known as Mount Scenery (or The Mountain), is a Holocene lava dome that overtops a major collapse scarp that formed about 100,000 years ago.  Flank domes were constructed on the SW, SE, east, and NE sides of the island near the coast.  A large andesitic lava flow entered the sea on the NE flank, forming the Flat Point Peninsula, the only site level enough on which to locate the island's airport.  The village of The Bottom overlies pyroclastic-surge deposits that contain European pottery fragments and were radiocarbon dated at 280 +/- 80 years before present.  The village was settled in 1640 on grassy meadows on the volcano's flanks reflecting initial vegetation recovery following destruction of tropical rainforests by pyroclastic flows and surges.  Lava dome growth may also have occurred during this SW-flank eruption.

Construction of the Grand Découverte volcano about 0.2 million years ago (Ma) was followed by caldera formation after a plinian eruption about 0.1 Ma, and then by construction of the Carmichaël volcano within the caldera. Two episodes of edifice collapse and associated large debris avalanches formed the Carmichaël and Amic craters about 11,500 and 3100 years ago, respectively. The presently active La Soufrière volcano subsequently grew within the Amic crater. The summit consists of a flat-topped lava dome, and several other domes occur on the southern flanks. Most historical eruptions have originated from NW-SE-trending fissure systems that cut across the summit and upper flanks.  A relatively minor phreatic eruption in 1976-77 caused severe economic disruption when Basse-Terre, the island's capital city, which lies immediately below the volcano, was evacuated.

The 3.5 x 5-km-wide caldera formed about 32-39,000 years ago in conjunction with the eruption of the Choiseul Tuff. A larger depression has been interpreted to have formed by edifice collapse, and bathymetry has identified large submarine debris-avalanche deposits off the west coast of the island. This depression and associated volcanic vents and geothermal areas is also known as the Soufrière volcanic centre. Numerous resurgent post-caldera lava domes fill the caldera floor. The latest dated magmatic eruptions took place about 20,000 years ago, but younger undated lava domes and explosion craters are present. The only known Holocene eruptive activity was a minor phreatic eruption in the Sulfur Springs geothermal area in 1766 CE that ejected a thin ash layer over a wide area. A volcanic earthquake swarm centered 6 km ESE of the caldera occurred in 1990.

A lava dome was emplaced in the summit crater in 1971 during a strictly effusive eruption, forming an island in a lake that filled the crater prior to an eruption in 1979.  The lake was then largely ejected during a series of explosive eruptions, and the dome was replaced with another.

The 1.6-km wide summit crater, whose NE rim is cut by a crater formed in 1812, lies on the SW margin of the 2.2-km-wide Somma crater, which is breached widely to the SW as a result of slope failure.  Frequent explosive eruptions since about 4300 years ago produced pyroclastic deposits of  the Yellow Tephra Formation, which blanket much of the island.

Thule Islands	13201	390070	Stratovolcano	Caldera	Explosion crater	NAN	NAN	NAN	Subduction zone / Oceanic crust (< 15 km)	Andesite / Basaltic Andesite	United Kingdom	Confirmed Eruption	1975	0	0	NAN	NAN	NAN	NAN	1	?	-59.458	-27.186	1075	The Thule Islands, at the southern end of the South Sandwich island arc bordering the Scotia Sea, consist of three stratovolcanoes constructed along an E-W-trending line. An ice-filled 1.5-2 km wide caldera truncates the summit of andesitic-dacitic Thule, the westernmost island, and a 4.3 x 4.8 km submarine caldera forms Douglas Strait between Thule and basaltic-to-dacitic Cook Island. Another possible submarine caldera lies east of Cook Island and south of basaltic-andesite Bellingshausen, the easternmost island. The age of Cook Island is uncertain, but steam was observed at the summit crater of Thule Island in 1962, and ash was seen on the surface of the ice there and on Bellingshausen Island, indicating possible 20th-century eruptions (Baker, 1968). Bellingshausen Island has a youthful, relatively ice-free profile and an extensive well-preserved lava field on its southern flank. A small explosion crater formed on the southern flank of Bellinghausen Island sometime between 1964 and 1986.
