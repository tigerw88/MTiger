The circular island group is composed of overlapping shield volcanoes cut by at least four partially overlapping calderas. The oldest southern caldera was formed about 180,000 years before present (BP), followed by the Skaros caldera about 70,000 years BP, and then the Cape Riva caldera about 21,000 years BP. The youngest caldera formed about 3600 years BP during the Late-Bronze-Age Minoan eruption  that forced abandonment of the thriving Aegean Sea island. Post-Minoan eruptions beginning in 197 BCE constructed a series of lava domes and flows that form two islands near the center of the caldera. A submarine eruption took place in 1650 AD outside the caldera NE of Thera. The latest eruption at Santorini produced a small lava dome and flow in 1950, accompanied by explosive activity.

The island was constructed during the past 150,000 years, with three cone-building stages including explosive and effusive andesitic eruptions and effusive and extrusive dacitic and rhyolitic activity.  The age of the caldera is variously considered to be <24,000 years before present (BP) (Keller et al., 1990) and >44,000 years BP (Limburg and Varekamp, 1991).  Five large post-caldera lava domes completely fill the western part of the caldera.  The NE-most (Boriatiko) and SW-most (Karaviotis) lava domes and flows are significantly younger than the other domes.  A sixth post-caldera dome, outside the SW caldera rim, produced lava flows that reached the coast.  Historical phreatic eruptions occurred from craters within the caldera between 1422 and 1888.  Intense hydrothermal activity continues in the form of many fumaroles on the caldera floor and hot springs along the coast.

Lava domes of the Haroharo complex, at the northern end of the Okataina Volcanic Centre, occupy part of the 16 x 26 km Pleistocene Haroharo caldera, which formed incrementally between 300,000 and 50,000 years before present (BP). The oldest exposed rocks on the caldera floor are about 22,000 years old. The Tarawera complex at the southern end of Okataina consists of 11 rhyolitic lava domes and associated lava flows. The oldest domes were formed as late as about 15,000 years BP, and the youngest were formed in the Kaharoa eruption about 800 years BP. The NE-SW Tarawera vent lineation extends from the two dacitic cones of Maungaongaonga and Mangakakaramea on the SW to Mount Edgecumbe on the NE.  Construction of the Haroharo and Tarawera complexes impounded lakes Rotoiti, Totoehu, Okataina, and Tarawera against the outer margins of the Okataina ring structure.

The outer flanks of the 688-m-high asymmetrical pyroclastic shield volcano are formed by thick pyroclastic-flow deposits. The 8 x 14 km caldera is widely breached on the east, where its floor is flooded by Blanche Bay and was formed about 1400 years ago. An earlier caldera-forming eruption about 7100 years ago is now considered to have originated from Tavui caldera, offshore to the north. Three small stratovolcanoes lie outside the northern and NE caldera rims. Post-caldera eruptions built basaltic-to-dacitic pyroclastic cones on the caldera floor near the NE and western caldera walls. Several of these, including Vulcan cone, which was formed during a large eruption in 1878, have produced major explosive activity during historical time.

The 1991 eruption, one of the world's largest of the 20th century, ejected massive amounts of tephra and produced voluminous pyroclastic flows, forming a small, 2.5-km-wide summit caldera whose floor is now covered by a lake.  Caldera formation lowered the height of the summit from 1745 to 1486 m.  Although the eruption caused hundreds of fatalities and major damage with severe social and economic impact, successful monitoring efforts greatly reduced the number of fatalities.  Widespread lahars that redistributed products of the 1991 eruption have continued to cause severe disruption.  At least six major eruptive periods, interrupted by lengthy quiescent periods, have occurred from modern Pinatubo volcano during the past 35,000 years.  Most of these have produced major pyroclastic flows and lahars that were even more extensive than in 1991.

It is the dominant feature within a larger volcano-tectonic depression composed of two parts: a stratovolcano with a 2-km-wide Holocene caldera, and a large lava dome on its eastern flank. The steep-walled caldera, now filled by a lake, was formed during a major explosive eruption about 7000 years ago. An arcuate zone of pre-caldera flank lava domes nearly surrounds the volcano, and post-caldera domes form islands in the caldera lake. Late-stage olivine basalts were erupted along a NE-trending line in the southern part of the depression. The latest dated eruption took place about 500 years ago and marks the youngest known eruption from the Sredinny Range volcanoes.

This eruption was the world's largest during the 20th century and produced a voluminous rhyolitic airfall tephra and the renowned Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes (VTTS) ash flow.  At the end of the eruption a small, 65-m-high, 400-m-wide lava dome grew to an elevation of 841 m within the source vent of the VTTS ashflow, a 2-km-wide area of subsidence NW of Trident volcano.  The NE side of the Falling Mountain lava dome of the Trident volcanic cluster, as well as Broken Mountain and Baked Mountain, was removed by collapse of the Novarupta depression, which is marked by radial and scalloped arcuate fractures.  Much larger collapse took place at Katmai volcano, 10 km to the east, where a 3 x 4 km wide caldera formed in response to magma reservoir drainage toward Novarupta.

Glacier Peak is a dacitic-andesitic stratovolcano with summit and flank lava domes; it resembles Mount St. Helens in its explosive vigor. More than a dozen glaciers descend its flanks, prompting its name. Although its summit towers 3000 m above surrounding valleys, the volcano was constructed above a high ridge and is itself less than 1000 m high. Repeated major explosive eruptions associated with lava dome growth during the late Pleistocene and Holocene deposited tephra over wide distances to the east. Voluminous pyroclastic flows and mudflows extended into the Puget Sound lowlands to the west and diverted several river courses into adjacent valleys. The latest eruption only a few hundred years ago was noted by indigenous Pacific Northwest Indians, and hot springs occur on its flanks.

The modern edifice was constructed during the last 2200 years, when the volcano produced basaltic as well as andesitic and dacitic products from summit and flank vents.  Historical eruptions in the 19th century originated from the Goat Rocks area on the north flank, and were witnessed by early settlers.

The caldera, which lies immediately east of the capital city of San Salvador, is strongly controlled by regional faults of the central Salvador graben. Four major dacitic-rhyolitic explosive eruptions during the late Pleistocene and Holocene produced extensive pyroclastic-flow and pyroclastic-fall deposits that blanket much of El Salvador. The latest collapse resulted from the massive 5th century CE Terra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption, which produced widespread pyroclastic flows and devastated early Mayan cities.  Post-caldera eruptions formed a series of glassy dacitic and andesitic lava domes within the lake and near its shore. The Islas Quemadas, a group of low islets in the center of the lake that mark the summit of a largely submerged lava dome, were formed in 1879-80 during the only historical eruption of Ilopango.

Volcán Ticsani resembles Huaynaputina in its dacitic composition and explosive eruptive style. Both volcanoes lie about 50 km behind the main volcanic front of the Peruvian Andes. A fresh-looking lava field lies at the NW base of the youthful-looking, unglaciated volcano. A major debris avalanche produced by collapse of the volcano partially filled the Río Tambor to the south. Emplacement of three lava domes since the end of the Pleistocene was accompanied by explosive eruptions. No historical eruptions are known, but fumarolic activity continues, and pumice from the crater containing the youngest lava dome overlies tephra from the 1600 CE Huaynaputina eruption.

The volcano has no prominent topographic expression and lies within a 2.5-km-wide depression formed by edifice collapse and further excavated by glaciers within an older edifice of Tertiary-to-Pleistocene age. Three overlapping ash cones with craters up to 100 m deep were constructed during the 1600 CE eruption on the floor of the ancestral crater, whose outer flanks are heavily mantled by ash deposits from the 1600 eruption. This powerful fissure-fed eruption may have produced nearly 30 cu km of dacitic tephra, including pyroclastic flows and surges that traveled 13 km to the east and SE. Lahars reached the Pacific Ocean, 120 km away. The eruption caused substantial damage to the major cities of Arequipa and Moquengua, and regional economies took 150 years to fully recover.

A major debris-avalanche deposit produced by collapse of the older volcano about 150,000 years ago extends eastward into Argentina and diverges around the north and south sides of the older Cerro Rosado stratovolcano 17 km east of Llullaillaco.  Construction of several lava domes and flows was associated with growth of the modern cone.  The two most prominent flows contain distinct flow levees and ridges and extend down the northern and southern flanks.  These two extremely youthful-looking dacitic flows were initially considered to be of Holocene age, but more recent Ar/Ar dating indicates that they are of late Pleistocene age (Richards and Villeneuve, 2001).  Two explosive eruptions and another that may have included lava effusion were reported from Llullaillaco in the 19th century.

Early work had identified only a single explosive eruption during the early Holocene prior to the major 2008 eruption, but later work has identified multiple explosive eruptions throughout the Holocene.  A rhyolitic, 962-m-high obsidian lava dome occupies much of the caldera floor.  Obsidian cobbles from this dome found in the Blanco River are the source of prehistorical artifacts from archaeological sites along the Pacific coast as far as 400 km away from the volcano to the north and south.  The caldera is breached on the SW side by a river that drains to the bay of Chaitén, and the high point on its southern rim reaches 1122 m.

A previously suggested vent location (Shipton, 1960) turned out to be a glacial nunatak of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. The Volcán Viedma eruptive center is a subglacial dacitic volcano beneath the Patagonian Icecap west of the spectacular granitic spires of the Cerro Torre, Cerro Fitz Roy area. Only part of the older edifice rises above the surface of the icecap. Four large craters or calderas between 1.5 and 4 km in diameter are located along a N-S line. The 1988 eruption deposited ash and pumice on the Patagonian Icecap and produced a mudflow that reached Viedma Lake.

Ash deposits from eruptions of this dominantly dacitic volcano were visible on aerial photos taken during several occasions during the 20th century, and older ash layers form prominent markers on outflow glaciers of the Patagonian icecap.

Volcanoes of the Australandean volcanic zone originated from subduction of the Antarctic plate beneath the South American plate.  The Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World synonyms for Lautaro (Cerro Pirámide, Chalten, and Chaltel) are actually synonyms of the dramatic Patagonian granitic peak of Cerro Fitz Roy (Moreno 1985, pers. comm.).
